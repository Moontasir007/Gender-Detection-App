# Gender Detection App

This project is a Gender Detection App that utilizes machine learning techniques to classify an individual's gender based on specific features or datasets. The app is designed to be simple, user-friendly, and efficient, making it suitable for various applications, including educational purposes, research, and real-world implementations. `As the folder size is bigger than 100MB, we added it in the releases.`

## Features

- Machine Learning Integration: Uses pre-trained models for high accuracy.
- User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use UI for data input and results visualization.
- Fast and Efficient: Quick processing with optimized algorithms.
- Customizable: Extend or adapt the app to support additional datasets or features.
